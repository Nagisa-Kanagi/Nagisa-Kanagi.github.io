    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My target audience for this website is anyone living in America that may want information about the weather.</p>
    <p>Whether they be local, or just visiting an area, it will give everyone the accurate weather information they need.</p>
    <p>I expect that people will be trying to access my website mostly on phones and tablets, but I also need to be prepared for people accessing my site with their laptop or PC.</p>
